<ul>
<li>
<p>Pieces of the Draconic Prophesy are always written in twisting knot-like patterns that bely their secretive contents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fragments of Draconic Prophesy appear in crumbling ancient ruins all over Eberron, it is thought to be impossible to compile it all into a single piece.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scholars agree that the prophesy's individual pieces are equally as prophetic as the whole may be. A passage may stand alone as a prophesy relevant to many points in time, and each passage may be averted or fulfilled by the acts of individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &quot;Chamber&quot; is whispered of as a secret society of dragonkin devoted to studying the Draconic Prophesy and using its revelations to slowly manipulate world events.</p>

<h5 id="north-room">North Room <a class="direct-link" href="#north-room">#</a></h5>
<p>If the Chamber of Dragons tastes fresh blood, its champions will rise to defend hallowed ground and thieves will topple and Living flesh will not recover that which the Chamber conceals.</p>

<h4 id="odious-studies">Odious Studies <a class="direct-link" href="#odious-studies">#</a></h4>
<p>In his studies of the Knowledge Stone from the temple of the Shadow, Odious has found these fragments of the prophesy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If red flame is case upon shadowed walls, they will crumble.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A crystal shard will stir the small folk to action against threats unknown.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If rubies adorn pale scales, they need fear no corrosion while the stars peek down upon them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If Earthbound Scales entreat with Bones once Living, the Chamber will yield to new bearers that which toppled proud wings.</p>

<p>A vision reaches you as you rest and reflect on the last week's events, past or future, you are not certain. You are certain that it is you however.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are kneeling before a black dragon flanked by undead in an dank cave. Dark robed figures stand in a semicircle behind you chanting a name: <strong>Altarion</strong>. Beneath the dragon's claw lies a pile of human skulls. You hold out your prize for the dragon, a Shard of Siberys, glowing faintly in the gloom. The dragon wraps its jet-black claws around the shard and smiles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="therendor-18%2C-998-yk">Therendor 18, 998 YK <a class="direct-link" href="#therendor-18%2C-998-yk">#</a></h4>
<p>While you turn your attention inwards and meditate on the experiences of the past few days a vision comes to you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A desk and office containing books and maps. You know that the planes of Khyber's Essences are warded away by Syberis' Moons. You check your math against a calendar, the timing must be right. The Gateway moon must be full for the planar ritual to succeed.</p>
<p>Your lord will be pleased by your work. <strong>Altarion</strong>, Black Herald of Khyber, rewards his faithful.</p>
