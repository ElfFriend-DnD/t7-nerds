### Draconic Prophesy

#### The nature of the Draconic Prophesy

- Pieces of the Draconic Prophesy are always written in twisting knot-like patterns that bely their secretive contents.

- Fragments of Draconic Prophesy appear in crumbling ancient ruins all over Eberron, it is thought to be impossible to compile it all into a single piece.

- Scholars agree that the prophesy's individual pieces are equally as prophetic as the whole may be. A passage may stand alone as a prophesy relevant to many points in time, and each passage may be averted or fulfilled by the acts of individuals.

- The "Chamber" is whispered of as a secret society of dragonkin devoted to studying the Draconic Prophesy and using its revelations to slowly manipulate world events.


#### Dragon Barrow

> ##### South Room
>
> If red claw strikes whispering stone while gate is wide, the time of stillness will come to green lands.

> ##### North Room
>
> If the Chamber of Dragons tastes fresh blood, its champions will rise to defend hallowed ground and thieves will topple and Living flesh will not recover that which the Chamber conceals.

> ##### Main Entrance
>
> East lies betrayal, West lies courageous, North lies a Scholar

> ##### West Room
>
> If living flesh touches that which the Chamber seals away, red covers the floor.

#### Odious Studies
In his studies of the Knowledge Stone from the temple of the Shadow, Odious has found these fragments of the prophesy:

> If red flame is case upon shadowed walls, they will crumble.

> A crystal shard will stir the small folk to action against threats unknown.

> If rubies adorn pale scales, they need fear no corrosion while the stars peek down upon them.

> If Earthbound Scales entreat with Bones once Living, the Chamber will yield to new bearers that which toppled proud wings.

### Visions

#### Therendor 13, 998 YK

A vision reaches you as you rest and reflect on the last week's events, past or future, you are not certain. You are certain that it is you however.

> You are kneeling before a black dragon flanked by undead in an dank cave. Dark robed figures stand in a semicircle behind you chanting a name: **Altarion**. Beneath the dragon's claw lies a pile of human skulls. You hold out your prize for the dragon, a Shard of Siberys, glowing faintly in the gloom. The dragon wraps its jet-black claws around the shard and smiles.

#### Therendor 18, 998 YK

While you turn your attention inwards and meditate on the experiences of the past few days a vision comes to you.

> A desk and office containing books and maps. You know that the planes of Khyber's Essences are warded away by Syberis' Moons. You check your math against a calendar, the timing must be right. The Gateway moon must be full for the planar ritual to succeed.
>
> Your lord will be pleased by your work. **Altarion**, Black Herald of Khyber, rewards his faithful.
