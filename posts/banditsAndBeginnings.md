> ### Quick Summary
> Our party has been traveling from Fairhaven to Askelios for the last four days. Less than half a day from Askelios, they were beset by bandits on the road! Vista was able to catch a wizard off guard while Odious and Cheya handled two bandits down below.

## Recorded by Odious R. Cleric of Aureon

Hired by House Cannith to transport a wagonload of goods to Askelios. En route, less than a day from destination, ambushed by thugs. Kindly escorted them to them to the beyond. An order written on parchment denoted one "Klarg" as the one who ordered the thugs to attack us. 

Searched the area to find clues leading to the conclusion that our employer and their companion have been taken by Klarg's thugs. Decided pursuit was the best option.
