Overnight Odious studied the tome he snatched and learned that the two gems were Knowledge Stones. These knowledge stones undoubtedly hold secret arcane knowledge, and are also useful tools for divination magic, but are dangerous to use without good knowledge of the wards protecting them.

In the morning a roar rang out through the valley from behind the party, in the direction of the now-ruined excavation. Skelly and Odious decided to investigate and found a Young-looking White Dragon surrounded by kobold minions attacking the magical tent that the professors were holed up in.

After a lot of deliberation, and an unhelpful Augury portent, Skelly took one of the knowledge stones from Odious and decided to go talk to the dragon.

> I am Cryovain the White, Student of the Prophesy, Operator of the Observatory. Who are you to defy me, mortal?

What followed was a tense attempt at negotiation between Skellyfingers and Cryovain. In the end Skelly gave up the knowledge stone which Cryovain snatched up and flew off.

> Thank you for your cooperation, mortal.

After the kobolds and dragon retreated, Skelly regrouped with Odious and headed back to town. Along the way, two figures emerged from their hiding places and told the party that the Baron Wester had hired them to help as well. One of them was a tall Firbolg whose figure was crusted with mushrooms and a small spore cloud. The other was plainly a shifter.

Returning to town, Odious decided to take a detour to Zenden and catch up with the party at the Baron's place. The rest of the party looked around at the varous shops and vendors available to them. This was the first town of any noteworthy size that Gray had seen, and he was very interested in everything, including beer. Odious checked in with Melissa d'Sivis at the town Library and School, where he learned about the Draconic Prophesy, and checked out a book about the topic.

Regrouping at the Baron's mansion, the party recounted what they learned and collected the reward for completing the Baron's tasks. The Baron didn't take the news very well. He asked the party to do several more tasks to help deal with the dragon's increasing hostility.

- Clear out Axeholm to the south. The Town needs a stronghold to flee to and this one is close enough to be a good candidate, Boldrei only knows what might be living there now though.
- Retreive Alfonz and Falcon, both veterans of the last war in the area, to report to the Baron.
- Investigate the old Dragon Barrow north east of town and see if it has anything that might help you kill the dragon.

The party agreed and left the Baron to his business. They retired at Percival's Inn after doing some more shopping.
