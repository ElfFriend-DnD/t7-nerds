      <h1>The Dragon Barrow</h1>

<p>The blood of the sentries still on their swords the party forged downwards into the barrow's unknown depths. The darkness prompted Odious and Skelly to bring light sources out.</p>
<p>The chamber at the bottom of the stairs opened in the four cardinal directions and its walls were inscribed with murals and writing clearly ancient draconic.</p>
<p>Southwards there was a light source glowing faintly, drawing the party that direction. They saw the remains of a kobold who had succumbed to a pit trap. The room beyond was bare except for the writing covering the walls.</p>
<p>While Odious was studying this writing, movement was detected in the chamber they had just come from. The party hid and attempted to lure the kobolds towards them. It almost worked, but a fight broke out in the cramped quarters down below the mound.</p>
<p>The noise of this fight drew other enemies and soon there were a dozen or so creatures engaged in a scrappy close-quarters fight. Spells were slung and blades flashed. Halfway through the fight, the leader of the Kobolds made his presence known.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop what you're doing and we won't destroy you. You've been very cooperative with our master so far, we would hate to sour such a relationship further.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A brief lull in the fighting allowed Skelly to confirm that Cryovain the White was the master of these Kobolds, this was one of his Leuitenants.</p>
<p>Rather than comply, the party fought on and the kobolds showed them the danger of close-quarters fighting with the underground-favored race. A scrappy, desperate fight later, the remaining battered and bloodied kobolds fled for the entrance.</p>
<p>With the barrow empty now, the party moved about looking at what the kobolds were investigating. Grey was concerned at the creatures one of the Kobolds was using as a weapon, and he rescued a skunk, which he escorted to the forest. Odious and Skelly found a chamber full of an Ancient Dragon's bones, it's skull prominently displayed. A piece of the Draconic Prophesy rang in his head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Earthbound Scales entreat with Bones once Living, the Chamber will yield to new bearers that which toppled proud wings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Entreat. As in, to provide with a treat.&quot; Odious contemplated. &quot;A blood sacrifice?&quot; Skelly suggested.</p>
<p>He pricked his hand and smeared some blood on the skull. Immediately, a chill whisper echoed in the cave &quot;If the Chamber of Dragons tastes fresh blood, its champions will rise to defend hallowed ground...&quot; One of two sarcophogi cracked open and a ghostly figure emerged, and attacked.</p>
<p>Skelly and Odious fought the specter off, and realized that there was yet more ancient Draconic writing on the walls here. &quot;Perhaps we should read this before we try something else.&quot;</p>
