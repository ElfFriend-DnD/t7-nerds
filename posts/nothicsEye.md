> ### Quick Summary
> Skellyfingers had just cleared away enough rubble to reveal the hidden treasure room when Odious met them. Together they entered and encountered a Nothic. Eventually Odious decided to try and remove the Nothic's Eye, and succeeded with the help of Ruby and Skelly.
>
> After the fight, Odious grabbed the remaining gemstone from the treasure room and the whole temple began to collapse around the party. They dodged dipped dived ducked and dodged their way out and were promptly told off by the two dwarves running the excavation.
