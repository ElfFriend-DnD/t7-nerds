description: After the fighting, the party set about the business of investigting the barrow. Searching for anything that might help them "Kill a Dragon," Odious' studies of the Draconic Prophesy gave him a clue as to what they might find.

The party explored the barrow thoroughly, encountering a few traps but no enemies. Writing scribbled all over the walls marked this as a place where a student of the Draconic Prophesy was interred. Here are some snippets that Odious and Skelly translated and deciphered.

In the room at the base of the steps, where each other chamber connected this was written:

> East lies betrayal, West lies courageous, North lies a Scholar

In the Southern chamber, surrounded by a depiction of a ritual taking place atop a stone altar outdoors.

> If red claw strikes Whispering Stone while Gate is wide, the time of stillness will come to Green Lands.

In the northern chamber, where the bones of an ancient dragon are embedded in the walls.

> If the Chamber of Dragons tastes fresh blood, its champions will rise to defend hallowed ground and thieves will topple and Living flesh will not recover that which the Chamber conceals.

To the East, a chamber with two sarcophogi was covered in writing but none of it made any sense, the more it was studied the less sense it made.

In the western chamber four sarcophogi lay each with gleaming swords clutched in the stony-figures' touch.

> If living flesh touches that which the Chamber seals away, red covers the floor.

Skelly decided not to heed the warning and pried one of these obviously magical swords off of a sarcophogi. Nothing seemed to happen, so Skelly clutched it as they continued exploring.

Odious was convinced that the Northern chamber was most likely to be of use. After agonizing over a passage he had discovered while reading the Tome and probing the Knowledge Stone, it was Skelly who solved the riddle.

> If Earthbound Scales entreat with Bones once Living, the Chamber will yield to new bearers that which toppled proud wings.

Skellyfingers the Bard sang a song to the dragon skull and entreated that it reveal the secrets to them. It did so, providing the party with the runes to create a weapon of dragonslaying, as well as some coinage.

Satisfied, the party set out westwards towards Alfonz's ranch.
