      <h1>Riddles and Bones</h1>

<p>The party explored the barrow thoroughly, encountering a few traps but no enemies. Writing scribbled all over the walls marked this as a place where a student of the Draconic Prophesy was interred. Here are some snippets that Odious and Skelly translated and deciphered.</p>
<p>In the room at the base of the steps, where each other chamber connected this was written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>East lies betrayal, West lies courageous, North lies a Scholar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Southern chamber, surrounded by a depiction of a ritual taking place atop a stone altar outdoors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If red claw strikes Whispering Stone while Gate is wide, the time of stillness will come to Green Lands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the northern chamber, where the bones of an ancient dragon are embedded in the walls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the Chamber of Dragons tastes fresh blood, its champions will rise to defend hallowed ground and thieves will topple and Living flesh will not recover that which the Chamber conceals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the East, a chamber with two sarcophogi was covered in writing but none of it made any sense, the more it was studied the less sense it made.</p>
<p>In the western chamber four sarcophogi lay each with gleaming swords clutched in the stony-figures' touch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If living flesh touches that which the Chamber seals away, red covers the floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Skelly decided not to heed the warning and pried one of these obviously magical swords off of a sarcophogi. Nothing seemed to happen, so Skelly clutched it as they continued exploring.</p>
<p>Odious was convinced that the Northern chamber was most likely to be of use. After agonizing over a passage he had discovered while reading the Tome and probing the Knowledge Stone, it was Skelly who solved the riddle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Earthbound Scales entreat with Bones once Living, the Chamber will yield to new bearers that which toppled proud wings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Skellyfingers the Bard sang a song to the dragon skull and entreated that it reveal the secrets to them. It did so, providing the party with the runes to create a weapon of dragonslaying, as well as some coinage.</p>
<p>Satisfied, the party set out westwards towards Alfonz's ranch.</p>
