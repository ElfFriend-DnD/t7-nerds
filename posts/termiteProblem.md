The party set off in the morning and arrived at Falcon's Lodge by mid afternoon. The veteran was rushing to saddle his horse when the party arrived, and his warforged companion Rustbucket beckoned the party over. He explained that a man had stumbled in and collapsed less than an hour ago. Falcon is about to head to Adabra to get him more medical attention.

Falcon told the party that the woodcutter's comrades are probably in danger, and they should go see if they can help. He also told them he would reward them handsomely if they bring back the head of whatever attacked. On his way out, Falcon agreed to meet with the "Pompous, blathering, indecisive" Baron Wester.

With this new quest in mind, the party rushed for the woodcutter's camp. Arriving in the early evening, the camp was unnervingly still. The ground was clearly disturbed in places, and Grey smelled an unfamiliar smell on the air mixed with sweat, blood, and fear centered on an old ruined cabin in the middle of camp.

Cautiously the party moved forward. On the fringes of the camp the ground trembled beneath them and a huge insectoid monstrosity erupted from the earth below, spewing acid and swinging pincer-like mandibles. Odious uttered a quick prayer and a searing bolt of radiant energy smote the creature where it stood.

No sooner than the party gathered their wits after the fight did they jump down into the tunnel left behind by the monster. Not long down the dark, musty tunnel did they encounter another of the things. The fight was more claustrophobic in these close quarters but the party was victorious.

Deciding that the tunnels weren't the best place to fight these things, the party retreated back to the surface to find night had fallen. The sole standing cabin had three survivors who uneasily let Skelly and friends in, and agreed that spending the night to fight in the morning was the best play.
