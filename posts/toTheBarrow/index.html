      <h1>Off to the Barrow</h1>

<p>Feeling rested, the party explored the rest of the ripped up logger's camp. They dispatched two more Ankhegs, and probed for the reason the beasts congregated here. Gray found a smashed pot of Ankheg Pheremones, which he promptly cleaned up to prevent further incursion. One of the survivors said that he saw a winged kobold over the camp early in the morning yesterday, before the attacks, drop something into the middle of camp. Skelly and Odious managed to mount an Ankheg Head above the logger's cabin door.</p>
<p>With all of that done, the party moved on Northeast towards the dragon barrow. As they left the camp, a white dragon was just barely visible circling high overhead. It took two full days of travel to arrive at the Barrow, during which time Skelly worked on a song to commemorate their deeds as Odious studied his tome and Gray brewed potions.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, the party scouted the barrow and saw a small group of kobolds at its crest keeping watch. Deciding to press forward in the creeping gloom, they attacked and subdued the sentries before any could sound an alarm.</p>
