> ### Quick Summary
> After the fight on the road, the party decides it's best to pursue the bodies of their employer and his companion. On the way, they were attacked again and managed to capture one of the bandits. After some questions and more tracking, the party finds the hideout.

## Recorded by Odious R. Cleric of Aureon

Cheya tracked the thugs and we were attacked again on their trail. Captured one of the thugs, interrogated him to lead us to where our employer was taken. However, it is made known that our employer has been taken elsewhere and the thug is unaware of where. We decide to use this thug as bait and have him lead us to their base to collect more information about Gundren's fate and find out what the deal is with Klarg.

We left preparing to enter a cavern with a stream. 

### Compatriate Assessment:
- Cheya appears to be attuned to the wilderness and can assume the form of a bear and communicate with them. 
- Crunch's name is derived from the last sound his enemies will ever make when he attacks with reckless abandonment. 
- Vista is quick to take off on their own and so far has demonstrated a variety of talents from stealth to trap disarming to scaling cliffsides.
