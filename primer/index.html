<h3 id="eberron">Eberron <a class="direct-link" href="#eberron">#</a></h3>
<p>Eberron is a world where magic has influenced daily life in ways much like steam power influenced our world in the industrial revolution. Magic is a field of study that can be manipulated by those with enough skill and knowledge to create wonderous items, weapons, machines, and even life itself.</p>
<h3 id="khorvaire">Khorvaire <a class="direct-link" href="#khorvaire">#</a></h3>
<p>The continent of Khorvaire is recovering from The Last War, which ended four years ago on the Day of Mourning. The central nation of Cyre was engulfed in a magical mist that indiscriminantly annihiliated everything in its path. No one knows how it was caused, but everyone knows it by the name of Mourning.</p>
<h4 id="dragonmarked-houses">Dragonmarked Houses <a class="direct-link" href="#dragonmarked-houses">#</a></h4>
<p>The balance of power in Khorvaire is split between the Nations and the Dragonmarked Houses. Each Dragonmarked house's members are blessed with magical power that allows them to excell at a certain skillset. These guilds effectively monopolize the skillset they excell at, and they operate without heed to the geopolitical borders or issues of the Nations according to the Edicts of Korth. Below is a summary of each Dragonmarked House's specialty:</p>

<h3 id="aundair%2C-captial-city%3A-fairhaven">Aundair, Captial City: Fairhaven <a class="direct-link" href="#aundair%2C-captial-city%3A-fairhaven">#</a></h3>
<p>Our adventure takes place in the Northeastern corner of Aundair, a nation on the northern edge of the continent. Aundair is ruled by Queen Aurala ir’Wynarn and she has emphasized education and magical infrastructure in the nation. On average, an Aundairian is well educated and every Aundairian child is tested for magical aptitude at a young age, then trained to use those skills for Crown and Country.</p>
<h3 id="askelios">Askelios <a class="direct-link" href="#askelios">#</a></h3>
<p>We will join our party in the region around Askelios, an area still recovering from the ravages of war. The barony has three small hamlets that make up the town itself: Zenden, Dekkul, and Askelios. Last War veteran Baron Wester rules the barony from his manor in Askelios.</p>
<p><img src="/t7-nerds/img/askelios-town.png" alt="Map of Askelios Town."></p>
<p>To the North there is the sprawling untamed Whisper Wood. To the East, the Starpeak Mountains jut upwards abruptly; beyond the Starpeaks lies an area still teeming with the remains of an undead invastion from neighboring Karrnath. To the South, beyond the Aundair river rapids, the Trumpet Mountains form a neutral zone between Aundair and neighboring Thrane.</p>
<p><img src="/t7-nerds/img/askelios-region.png" alt="Map of Askelios Region."></p>
<h4 id="neutral-zone">Neutral Zone <a class="direct-link" href="#neutral-zone">#</a></h4>
<p>No resources within the Trumpet Mountains may be tapped according to the Treaty of Thronehold that ended the Last War. Neither side is allowed to send armed incursions within the neutral zone either, and it has become a haven for bandits and deserters because of this.</p>
<h2 id="the-adventure">The Adventure <a class="direct-link" href="#the-adventure">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="dragon-of-icespire-peak%2C-but-in-eberron">Dragon of Icespire Peak, But in Eberron <a class="direct-link" href="#dragon-of-icespire-peak%2C-but-in-eberron">#</a></h3>
<p>A White Dragon has been spotted in the Starpeaks acting decidedly un-dragon-like. Usually these intelligent creatures keep to themselves, most are devoted to the study of an ancient prophesy known as the Draconic Prophesy. Rarely do dragons cause trouble in Eberron. This white however has shown increasing signs of hostility and Baron Wester is growing anxious. He has hired Skellyfingers the Bard to sound the alarm on some of the more vulnerable outer settlements and attempt to gather useful items that may help get to the bottom of the issue at hand.</p>
<h3 id="contact%3A-baron-wester">Contact: Baron Wester <a class="direct-link" href="#contact%3A-baron-wester">#</a></h3>
<p>Baron Wester runs the town's job board and will be the central point of contact for this campaign's quests.</p>
<h4 id="task-overview">Task Overview <a class="direct-link" href="#task-overview">#</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Help Baron Wester handle the fallout caused by the White Dragon's increasingly erratic behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="compensation">Compensation <a class="direct-link" href="#compensation">#</a></h4>
<p>Baron Wester has a gold reward attached to each individual task he gives the party. Additionally, any items recovered in the line of duty not pertaining directly to the job at hand may be kept.</p>
<h4 id="assets">Assets <a class="direct-link" href="#assets">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Baron Wester's name carries weight in his barony, which encompasses the whole region.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notes-on-progression">Notes on Progression <a class="direct-link" href="#notes-on-progression">#</a></h2>
<p>Levelups will only happen in town. We're using milestone leveling, and the milestones are almost entirely going to be based around turning in quests.</p>
