![Map of Eberron's Aundair and surrounding nations.]({{site.baseurl}}/img/eberron-relevant.png)

### Eberron

Eberron is a world where magic has influenced daily life in ways much like steam power influenced our world in the industrial revolution. Magic is a field of study that can be manipulated by those with enough skill and knowledge to create wonderous items, weapons, machines, and even life itself.

### Khorvaire

The continent of Khorvaire is recovering from The Last War, which ended four years ago on the Day of Mourning. The central nation of Cyre was engulfed in a magical mist that indiscriminantly annihiliated everything in its path. No one knows how it was caused, but everyone knows it by the name of Mourning.

#### Dragonmarked Houses

The balance of power in Khorvaire is split between the Nations and the Dragonmarked Houses. Each Dragonmarked house's members are blessed with magical power that allows them to excell at a certain skillset. These guilds effectively monopolize the skillset they excell at, and they operate without heed to the geopolitical borders or issues of the Nations according to the Edicts of Korth. Below is a summary of each Dragonmarked House's specialty:

| Dragonmark  | House       | Race            | Guild Specialties                          |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Detection   | Medani      | Half-elf        | Bodyguards, investigation, risk management |
| Finding     | Tharashk    | Human, half-orc | Bounty hunting, investigation, prospecting |
| Handling    | Vadalis     | Human           | Animal training and breeding               |
| Healing     | Jorasco     | Halfling        | Healing                                    |
| Hospitality | Ghallanda   | Halfling        | Food, lodging, urban information           |
| **Making**  | **Cannith** | **Human**       | **Manufacturing**                          |
| Passage     | Orien       | Human           | Land transportation                        |
| Scribing    | Sivis       | Gnome           | Communication, translation, verification   |
| Sentinel    | Deneith     | Human           | Bodyguards, mercenaries                    |
| Shadow      | Phiarlan    | Elf             | Entertainment, espionage                   |
|             | Thuranni    | Elf             | Entertainment, assassination               |
| Storm       | Lyrandar    | Half-elf        | Air and sea transportation                 |
| Warding     | Kundarak    | Dwarf           | Banking, storage, prisons                  |

### Aundair, Captial City: Fairhaven

Our adventure takes place in the Northeastern corner of Aundair, a nation on the northern edge of the continent. Aundair is ruled by Queen Aurala irâ€™Wynarn and she has emphasized education and magical infrastructure in the nation. On average, an Aundairian is well educated and every Aundairian child is tested for magical aptitude at a young age, then trained to use those skills for Crown and Country.

### Askelios

We will join our party in the region around Askelios, an area still recovering from the ravages of war. The barony has three small hamlets that make up the town itself: Zenden, Dekkul, and Askelios. Last War veteran Baron Wester rules the barony from his manor in Askelios.

To the North there is the sprawling untamed Whisper Wood. To the East, the Starpeak Mountains jut upwards abruptly; beyond the Starpeaks lies an area still teeming with the remains of an undead invastion from neighboring Karrnath. To the South, beyond the Aundair river rapids, the Trumpet Mountains form a neutral zone between Aundair and neighboring Thrane.

#### Neutral Zone

No resources within the Trumpet Mountains may be tapped according to the Treaty of Thronehold that ended the Last War. Neither side is allowed to send armed incursions within the neutral zone either, and it has become a haven for bandits and deserters because of this.

## The Adventure

The party has spent the four days traveling from Fairhaven to Askelios escorting a wagonload of Cannith branded goods to be delivered to Barthen's Provisions in town. Gundren Rockseer set out on horseback when you left accompanied by Sildar Halwinter, an agent of the Queen. Gundren told you to meet him at Percival's Inn in Askelios after you deliver the items to Barthen's.

Elmar Barthen has been told you are headed his way, and will pay you 10gp each when you deliver the wagonload safely to his shop.

### Patron: House Cannith

Each of you has been hired by House Cannith to be a freelance group working under the Rockseer brothers.

#### Task

> Aid the Rockseers in any way to facilitate the resumption of operations within the Lost Mine of Phandelver.

#### Compensation

House Cannith has authorized the Rockseers to compensate you on an individual base rate of `2gp * Character Level` per day of working directly on a job for them. This contract is good for 1 month for up to 300gp per person, after which point it can be renegotiated. Additionally, any items recovered not pertaining directly to the job at hand may be kept.

#### Assets

- House Cannith branded goods can be purchased at a 10% discount from any authorized reseller.
- Each of you has been provided with paperwork and identification denoting your employment by a Dragonmarked House.
- If you need any house services, they can be purchased at the same 10% discount as goods.

#### Contact: The Rockseer Brothers

- Gundren
- Nundro
- Tharden

The Rockseers are three dwarven brothers sent as surveyors and scouts to attempt to rediscover and resume operations at a Cannith Base lost towards the beginning of the Last War, some 70 years ago. Gundren Rockseer recently reported to House leadership that they are pretty sure they've found the lost base, but need help in exploring and clearing the place of any hostiles.
